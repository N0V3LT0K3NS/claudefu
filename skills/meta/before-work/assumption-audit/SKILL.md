# Assumption Audit

**Status:** 📋 Stub — Implementation coming soon

## Purpose

Make implicit assumptions explicit before they cause problems.

## Intended Behavior

1. List stated requirements
2. Identify implicit assumptions about:
   - User context
   - Technical environment
   - Expected behavior
   - Unstated constraints
3. Challenge each assumption
4. Validate or invalidate
5. Surface for discussion

## Output

List of assumptions with their status (validated, invalid, needs checking).
