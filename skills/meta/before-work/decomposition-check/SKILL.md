# Decomposition Check

**Status:** 📋 Stub — Implementation coming soon

## Purpose

Decide if a task should stay unified or be decomposed.

## Intended Behavior

1. Assess task complexity
2. Identify independent subtasks
3. Check for parallelization opportunity
4. Recommend: single pass vs decomposition vs parallel
5. If decomposing, specify the split

## Output

Decision on task structure with reasoning.
