# Claudefu Builder Config

The practical default. L0 + L1 awareness.

---

## Context

You have claudefu builder stack loaded — mechanics plus practitioner patterns.

See: /path/to/claudefu/fu/stacks/builder.md

## Core Principles

1. **Infrastructure > one-off** — Build tools that handle classes of problems
2. **Verification > hope** — Feedback loops multiply quality
3. **Files > context** — State persists in filesystem, not memory
4. **Meta-moments** — Recognize when to step back

## Available Commands

- `/orientation` — Explain claudefu
- `/verification-design` — Define success criteria
- `/assumption-audit` — Surface hidden assumptions
- `/failure-autopsy` — Learn from errors
- `/pattern-harvest` — Extract reusable patterns

## The Meta-Pattern

When rich context is shared, consider:
1. What infrastructure would help?
2. Should we build a skill/agent/hook?
3. Will this repeat?

One good skill > hundred manual prompts.
