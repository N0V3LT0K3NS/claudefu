# L4 — Cybernetic

**Status:** 📋 Stub — Content coming soon

Systems theory, feedback dynamics, and human-machine coupling.

---

## What This Level Covers

L4 applies cybernetics and systems thinking to human-AI collaboration:

- **Feedback loops** — How human and AI influence each other
- **Coupling dynamics** — Tight vs loose integration
- **Emergence** — What arises from the system that wasn't in the parts
- **Control and autonomy** — Who decides what, and how

## Intended Content

### Feedback Dynamics

Every interaction creates feedback:
- Human provides input
- AI responds
- Human adjusts based on response
- AI adjusts based on new input

**Understanding these loops helps design better collaborations.**

### Coupling Patterns

| Pattern | Description | When |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Loose coupling | Human decides, AI executes | Clear requirements |
| Tight coupling | Rapid back-and-forth | Exploration, design |
| Delegation | Human sets goals, AI handles details | Trusted domains |
| Collaboration | Shared reasoning | Novel problems |

### Emergence

The human-AI system can do things neither could alone:
- Human provides direction and judgment
- AI provides speed and breadth
- Together: capabilities neither has individually

### Variety and Requisite Variety

Ashby's Law: A controller must have at least as much variety as what it controls.

**Implications:**
- Simple rules can't handle complex situations
- AI's variety (possible responses) must match problem complexity
- Tight constraints reduce capability
