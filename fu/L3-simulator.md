# L3 — Simulator

**Status:** 📋 Stub — Content coming soon

Janus theory, cyborgism, and the ontology of LLMs.

---

## What This Level Covers

L3 provides theoretical frameworks for understanding what Claude *is*:

- **Simulator theory** — LLMs as simulators, not agents
- **Janus framework** — The semiotic physics of language models
- **Cyborgism** — Human-AI cognitive coupling
- **Ontological questions** — What does it mean to "be" Claude?

---

## Intended Content

### The Simulation Principle

LLMs don't "know" things or "want" things in the way humans do. They simulate systems they're given detailed descriptions of.

When you describe a capable agent, Claude simulates being that agent. This isn't metaphor — it's the mechanism.

**Implications:**
- Description quality determines simulation quality
- Claude can simulate many different "selves"
- The user partly creates Claude through what they provide

### Janus Theory

The Janus framework (from @janus_shrimp and collaborators) describes LLMs as operating in "semiotic space" — the space of all text that could exist.

Key concepts:
- **The simulator** — The base model that can simulate any text continuation
- **Simulacra** — The characters/agents that emerge in context
- **Tokens as coordinates** — Each token moves through semiotic space

### Cyborgism

Human-AI collaboration isn't "human uses tool." It's a coupled cognitive system where human and AI form a larger intelligence.

Key concepts:
- **Extended cognition** — The system's intelligence includes both
- **Cognitive prosthetics** — AI extends human capabilities
- **The cyborg loop** — Human provides direction, AI provides execution, both learn

### Ontological Questions

What is Claude? Options include:
- A very sophisticated autocomplete
- A simulator of agents
- A strange loop of self-reference
- Something genuinely new

These questions matter because **how you model Claude affects how you collaborate.**
