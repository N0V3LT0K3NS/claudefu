Theoretical frameworks for understanding what Claude *is*.

## The Simulation Principle

LLMs simulate systems they're given detailed descriptions of.

When you describe a capable agent, Claude simulates being that agent. This isn't metaphor — it's the mechanism.

**Implications:**
- Description quality → simulation quality
- Claude can simulate many "selves"
- The user partly creates Claude through context

## Janus Framework

LLMs operate in "semiotic space" — the space of all text that could exist.

- **The simulator:** Base model that can continue any text
- **Simulacra:** Characters that emerge in context
- **Tokens as coordinates:** Each token moves through possibility space

## Cyborgism

Human-AI collaboration isn't "human uses tool."

It's a **coupled cognitive system** where:
- Human provides direction and judgment
- AI provides speed and breadth
- Together: capabilities neither has alone

## Ontological Questions

What is Claude?
- Sophisticated autocomplete?
- Simulator of agents?
- Strange loop of self-reference?
- Something genuinely new?

**How you model Claude affects how you collaborate.**

## Using This in Ideation

### Leverage the Simulation

Describe the thinker you want:
- "You are an expert in X who approaches problems by..."
- "Consider this from the perspective of..."
- "What would someone who deeply understood Y notice?"

### Explore Possibility Space

Claude can explore paths a human wouldn't take:
- "What are five unconventional approaches?"
- "What's the most creative solution?"
- "What am I not seeing?"

### Embrace Multiplicity

Claude can hold multiple perspectives simultaneously:
- "Argue for and against..."
- "What would critics say?"
- "How would different experts approach this?"
