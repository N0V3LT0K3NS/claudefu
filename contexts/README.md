# Contexts — Contemporary Context (Teaser)

**Status:** 🔮 Vision — Eventually separate repo

---

## What This Will Become

Contexts are domain-specific contemporary awareness packages:
- Current state of a field
- Key players and developments
- Recent changes and trends
- What matters now

Unlike fu (meta-cognitive patterns), contexts are about **content knowledge** of specific domains.

---

## Example: AI Landscape

See `ai-landscape/` for a worked example:
- Major labs and their focuses
- Recent model developments
- Emerging capabilities
- Current discourse themes

---

## Template

See `template/` for how to create new contexts.

---

## Future Plans

Contexts will eventually:
1. Move to a separate repository
2. Have their own update pipeline
3. Cover multiple domains
4. Be composable with fu

For now, this is a teaser of the concept.
